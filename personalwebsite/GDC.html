        <P> 
            NMSU GDC is a student run school organization focused on teaching and engaging in pratical game development. I have been active in this club since 
            my freshman year.

        <P> 
            Throughout my time period in this club we have group developed multiple games. This ranged from Virtual Reality titles to 2d rpg games. Through this experience
            I have learned both how to lead and be apart of a game development team. Furthermore the GDC actively engages in community services such as a charity stream each 
            november.
