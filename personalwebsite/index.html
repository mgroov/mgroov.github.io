                <p>Hello! I am Matthew Groover I am a Graduate Student at NMSU (New Mexico State University). 
                    My main focus is in game development and design. I graduated from NMSU with a bachelors in computer science in Spring of 2022.
                    My hobbies include Game Development Club, Reading and Gaming.     
                </p>

                 <P>I have gained proffesional experience in software development through an Internship over the Summer of 2020. During this Internship I was
                    charged with developing drone flight code for a Alamagordo based commpany called E.T.V (Emerging Technologies Ventures). Through this 
                    Internship I gained respect for the challenges that face proffesional development and prototyping.
                 </P>

                 <p>My current goals is to finish my Masters Degree and project. Then go out into the video game development industry. I believe that by completing this 
                    project I will gain appropriate understanding of the challenges faced in the video game development cycle. </p>
